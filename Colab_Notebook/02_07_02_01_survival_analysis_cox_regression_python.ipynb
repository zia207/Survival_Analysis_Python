Developed by Sir David Cox in 1972, this semi-parametric model is particularly useful because it does not require the specification of a baseline hazard function, making it flexible for analyzing survival data.\n",

        "***Key Concepts of Cox Regression***:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Hazard Function**:\n",
        "    -   The hazard function $h(t)$ represents the instantaneous rate at which events occur at time $t$, given that the subject has survived up to time $t$. It can be thought of as the risk of an event occurring in the next instant of time.\n",
        "2.  **Proportional Hazards Assumption**:\n",
        "    -   The key assumption of Cox regression is that the hazard ratios between different levels of the covariates are **proportional** over time. This means that the effect of the covariates on survival is constant and does not change as time progresses.\n",
        "3.  **Semi-parametric Model**:\n",
        "    -   The Cox model is called semi-parametric because it does not require a specific form for the baseline hazard function, ( h_0(t) ), making it flexible. It estimates the effect of covariates on the hazard function while leaving the baseline hazard unspecified.\n",
        "4.  **Hazard Ratio (HR)**:\n",
        "    -   The model estimates the **hazard ratio**, which quantifies the effect of a covariate on the hazard. A hazard ratio of:\n",
        "        -   **HR = 1**: No effect (covariate does not influence the risk).\n",
        "        -   **HR \\> 1**: Increased hazard (higher risk of the event).\n",
        "        -   **HR \\< 1**: Decreased hazard (lower risk of the event).\n",
        "\n",
        "***Cox Proportional Hazards Model Equation:***\n",
        "\n",
        "The Cox model can be written as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ h(t|X) = h_0(t) \\cdot \\exp(\\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + \\dots + \\beta_p X_p) $$\n",
        "\n",
        "Where: - $h(t|X)$ is the hazard at time $t$ for an individual with covariates $X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_p$. - $h_0(t)$ is the baseline hazard function (the hazard when all covariates are zero). - $\\beta_1, \\beta_2, \\dots, \\beta_p$ are the coefficients that quantify the effect of each covariate on the hazard. - $X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_p$ are the covariates (predictors or risk factors).\n",
        "\n",
        "The quantity $\\exp(\\beta)$ is the hazard ratio (HR) for each covariate, which represents the relative risk associated with a one-unit increase in that covariate.\n",
        "\n",
        "***Steps in Cox Regression***:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Model Fitting**: Fit the Cox model to the survival data by estimating the regression coefficients $\\beta$ for the covariates.\n",
        "2.  **Estimate Hazard Ratios**: Compute the hazard ratios $\\exp(\\beta)$, which tell how much the risk of the event changes with a one-unit increase in each covariate.\n",
        "3.  **Check the Proportional Hazards Assumption**: Verify if the proportional hazards assumption holds by assessing whether the hazard ratios remain constant over time.\n",
        "4.  **Interpretation**: Interpret the hazard ratios to understand how the covariates influence the time to event.\n"

        "\n",
        "***Steps for Fitting Cox Proportional Hazards Model Manually***\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Formulate the Model**: The Cox proportional hazards model estimates the effect of covariates (like age, sex, etc.) on the hazard rate. The model can be written as:\n",
        "\n",
        "    $$ h(t | X) = h_0(t) \\exp(\\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + \\dots + \\beta_p X_p) $$\n",
        "\n",
        "    where:\n",
        "\n",
        "    -   $h(t | X)$ is the hazard at time $t$ given covariates $X$,\n",

        "    -   $\\beta_1, \\beta_2, \\dots, \\beta_p$ are the coefficients to be estimated.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Partial Likelihood**: The Cox model uses partial likelihood instead of a full likelihood function, which does not require estimating the baseline hazard function. The partial likelihood for a sample with censored data is:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ L(\\beta) = \\prod_{i: \\delta_i = 1} \\frac{\\exp(\\beta^T X_i)}{\\sum_{j \\in R(t_i)} \\exp(\\beta^T X_j)} $$\n",

        "-   $\\delta_i$ is an indicator (1 if the event occurs, 0 if censored).\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Estimation**: The log-partial likelihood is maximized to estimate the coefficients $\\beta$.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Score and Information Matrix**: Use the score function (first derivative) and the observed information matrix (second derivative) to apply Newton-Raphson optimization to find the maximum likelihood estimates for (\\beta).\n",
        "\n",
        "This manual method demonstrates the key steps in Cox model estimation without relying on built-in R packages like `survival`. It replicates what the `coxph()` function would do under the hood.\n"

        "The Cox Proportional Hazards Model is a powerful tool for analyzing survival data and understanding how covariates impact the risk of an event over time. It is widely used in fields like medicine, epidemiology, and engineering, where time-to-event data is prevalent. The flexibility of not having to specify the baseline hazard makes it particularly popular for modeling survival data.\n",
