        "Joint frailty models extend standard frailty models by simultaneously analyzing two or more related survival processes, typically recurrent events (e.g., repeated hospitalizations or tumor recurrences) and a terminal event (e.g., death), which censors the recurrent process. These models account for the dependence between the processes through shared or correlated frailty terms, addressing informative censoring where the terminal event is influenced by the same unobserved heterogeneity as the recurrent events. Without joint modeling, separate analyses may lead to biased estimates because the terminal event is not independent of the recurrent process.\n",
        "\n",
        "In many studies, recurrent events are observed until a terminal event occurs, and these processes are correlated due to shared unobserved factors (e.g., frailty-prone individuals may have more recurrences and die earlier). Joint models capture this by linking the hazards via frailties, improving efficiency and reducing bias from ignoring dependence.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Frailty Role**: Frailties are random effects representing unobserved heterogeneity. In joint models, a shared frailty (e.g., $u_i$ for individual $i$ multiplies the baseline hazards of both processes, inducing positive correlation. Correlated frailties allow for more flexible dependence, including negative correlations.\n",

        "Joint frailty models provide a powerful framework for analyzing correlated survival processes, such as recurrent events censored by a terminal event, by incorporating shared or correlated random effects to model dependence and heterogeneity. They outperform separate or standard frailty models by addressing informative censoring, yielding unbiased estimates, and quantifying process associations via parameters like \\( \\alpha \\). In the readmission example, the model revealed that factors like tumor stage and comorbidity increase both re-hospitalization and mortality risks, with significant positive linkage between processes.\n",

They mitigate biases from ignored correlations but require careful assumption checks (e.g., frailty distribution) and computational resources. Compared to multi-state models, they emphasize unobserved heterogeneity over state transitions, making them ideal for frailty-driven dependence. Future extensions, like time-varying frailties, offer even greater flexibility.\n"
